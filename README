DOCUMENTATION of PIGS software

I.  Installing libraries needed to run PIGS

PIGS is implemented as a python script and requires python version 2.6 or higher.  PIGS makes use of the python libraries NetworkX v1.8.1, NumPy v1.8, and SciPy v0.13.2, all of which have been included in the directory ./python_libraries.  The libraries can be installed by decompressing the library tar file you wish to install, changing to the decompressed directory, and issuing the command "python setup.py install".  Further documentation on installing python libraries can be found at http://docs.python.org/2/install/


II.  Input

As input PIGS expects the edges of a connected component in the form of Refined IBD output as shown in ./example/example_input.ibd and a list of sample IDs as shown in ./example/example_samples.txt.  The RefinedIBD output lists the edges of the graph and the sample IDs lists the nodes of the graph.  

Refined IBD output is a tab-delimited text file with the following columns:
    1.  Individual1 
    2.  Individual1-Haplotype 
    3.  Individual2 
    4.  Indvidual2-Haplotype
    5.  Chromosome
    6.  Start Position
    7.  End Position
    8.  LOD Score

The list of samples is just a text file with one sample ID per line.


III.  Running PIGS

PIGS can be run by issuing the command:
    python <path_to_pigs>/pigs_v1.py -b <input_file> -m <tmp_dir> -l <sample_list>

Listed below are options to allow the user to run his/her analysis as they see fit.  PIGS does create a temporary directory but deletes it after the analysis is finished.

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help                                          show this help message and exit
    -b BGL_IBD_FILE, --bgl_ibd_file=BGL_IBD_FILE        Refined IBD output file, REQUIRED
    -l LIST_OF_IDVS, --list_of_idvs=LIST_OF_IDVS        List of sample IDs, REQUIRED
    -m TMP_DIR, --tmp_dir=TMP_DIR                       Temp directory to use, DEFAULT: ./
    -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output_file=OUTPUT_FILE           Output file path, DEFAULT: pigs_output.txt
    -p PRIOR_PROB, --prior_prob=PRIOR_PROB              Prior probability, DEFAULT: 0.004
    -t LOD_THRESHOLD, --lod_threshold=LOD_THRESHOLD     Minimum LOD threshold for an edge to be added to graph, DEFAULT: 0.01
    -s SAMPLING_TIME, --sampling_time=SAMPLING_TIME     Sampling time limit in seconds, DEFAULT: None


IV.  Output

PIGS outputs a tab-delimited text file of all edges in the graph.  The format is similar to the input but has 3 additional columns.  
    1.  Individual1 
    2.  Individual1-Haplotype 
    3.  Individual2 
    4.  Indvidual2-Haplotype
    5.  Chromosome
    6.  Start Position
    7.  End Position
    8.  LOD Score
    9.  Probability before PIGS analysis
    10. Probability after PIGS analysis
    11. True/False indicating whether the edge was added by PIGS


V.  Example

As an example we will walk through some different ways or running PIGS using the files in ./example.

If we wished to run PIGS on our data as is from ./ we would simply issue the command:
    python pigs_v1.py -b example/example_input.ibd -l example/example_samples.txt -o example/regular_output.txt

We could also specify a sampling time of 2 seconds:
    python pigs_v1.py -b example/example_input.ibd -l example/example_samples.txt -o example/two_second_output.txt -s 2

To change the prior probability:
    python pigs_v1.py -b example/example_input.ibd -l example/example_samples.txt -o example/two_second_output.txt -p 0.005

Or to change the LOD threshold for adding in edges:
    python pigs_v1.py -b example/example_input.ibd -l example/example_samples.txt -o example/two_second_output.txt -t 1

Or combining everything:
    python pigs_v1.py -b example/example_input.ibd -l example/example_samples.txt -o example/two_second_output.txt -s 2 -t 1 -p 0.005
